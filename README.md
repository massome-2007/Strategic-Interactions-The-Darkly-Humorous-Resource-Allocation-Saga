# Strategic Interactions: The Darkly Humorous Resource Allocation Saga

Project Overview:
This project uses game theory to solve resource allocation problems in two different scenarios. We'll focus on Nash Equilibrium and Pareto Efficiency to find the optimal resource distribution between two players.

Key Features:
Nash Equilibrium: Solves for the optimal strategy for both players where no one can improve their outcome by changing their strategy alone.

Linear Programming: Utilizes linear programming to efficiently solve the resource allocation problem.

Pareto Efficiency: Ensures the solution is optimal and cannot be improved upon without making at least one player worse off.

Explanation:
Utility Functions: Define utility functions representing each player's preferences in two different scenarios.

Constraints: Set constraints for resource allocation (both resources must be non-negative and within bounds).

Nash Equilibrium: Use linear programming to find the Nash Equilibrium for each scenario, where neither player can unilaterally improve their outcome.

Visualization: Plot the Nash Equilibrium for each scenario to visualize the solution.

This project demonstrates how to use game theory and decision-making models to solve resource allocation problems efficiently, providing clear and concise results.
